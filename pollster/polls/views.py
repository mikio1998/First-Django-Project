# A view function, or view for short, is a Python function 
# that takes a Web request and returns a Web response. 

# This response can be the HTML contents of a Web page, 
# or a redirect, or a 404 error, or an XML document, 
# or an image . . . or anything, really. 

# The view itself contains whatever arbitrary logic is 
# necessary to return that response. 

# render(request, template_name, context=None, content_type=None, status=None, using=None)Â¶
# Combines a given template with a given context dictionary 
# and returns an HttpResponse object with that rendered text.
